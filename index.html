<p>Taking dives into a variety of linux distributions (and other unix based OSes!).<br>We install them live on bare metal, test them out, live with them for a few days, livestream with them, edit on them... the whole package! After that, everything is compiled into a single, entertaining *hopefully* video.</p>

<p><b><u>Quick update on the steam highlights video:</u></b><br>

<br>

I was editing the stream highlights video today when I realized that OBS completely ignored my audio settings. You can only hear the game audio. My voice is basically non-existent. Either way, I decided to continue editing.
<br><br>
The video exported just fine with a file size of ~55GB. I started transcoding it to .m4v when Mint completely crashed and it now won't boot again. Trying the same thing on my Silverblue errors out but without any catastrophic damage.
<br><br>
What's for certain is that I have a loooot of stuff to talk about next Saturday. You DON'T want to miss it.
<br><br>
See you there!
